# Niceties

Niceties is a curated collection of small, thoughtful additions to Rails.
Nothing fancy, nothing heavy — just expressive, elegant helpers that make
everyday code smoother and more joyful.

It’s the kind of thing you might monkey-patch in your own app and forget about. Niceties gives those private little helpers a permanent, public home.

## ✨ Philosophy

Niceties is built on a few quiet principles:

- **Ergonomics matter.** Tiny syntax improvements compound across projects and years.
- **Less is more.** This isn’t a kitchen sink. Every addition is judged by feel.
- **No surprises.** If you have to explain what it’s doing, it probably doesn’t belong here.
- **Ruby’s voice, not ours.** Every method should *read* like Ruby. Nothing flashy, nothing clever for its own sake.

You should be able to drop Niceties into your app and feel like it’s always been there.

## 🫂 Contributing

Niceties is open to anyone with an idea that makes Ruby or Rails feel better to use.

If you’ve ever written a helper method and thought:

> _"This is too small for a gem, but I wish it lived somewhere..."_

That’s exactly what Niceties is for.

**Guiding questions for contributors:**

- Does this make everyday code more readable or expressive?
- Does it align with Ruby’s style and philosophy?
- Would I be delighted if this existed in the language?

If yes — open a PR or start a discussion.
